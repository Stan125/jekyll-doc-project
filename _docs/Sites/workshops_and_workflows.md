Statistical Consulting within the Sydney Informatics Hub offers a modular training programme made up of 1.5 hour workshops, each focusing on a single statistical method. Statistical Workflows giving practical step-by-step instructions applicable in any software are used and include experimental design, exploratory analysis, modelling, assumption testing, model interpretation and presentation of results. They are integrated into Training Pathways to give a holistic understanding of data analysis from a statistical perspective. You are encouraged to design a custom programme by mixing and matching workshops from different training pathways tailored to your research needs.

We continue to develop and improve our workshop offering through feedback and the needs we identify in our statistical consulting service. The workshop slides will be periodically updated, so we encourage you to regularly come back and download the most recent versions. The version number is shown next to the slides for download.

### Pathways
#### Foundational Statistics 

* **Research Essentials**: Gives an 8-step generic research workflow from study inception to publication that can be applied to any statistical analysis, no matter the analysis method, discipline, or software used. By teaching you to classify your data into appropriate data types and to use appropriate visualisations to explore your data, this workshop empowers you to choose the appropriate analysis method and gives examples of common inferential analyses. 
  * [Research Essentials: Analysing your Data v4.3](assets/files/Research%20Essentials%20v4.3%2022-11-15%20HANDOUT.pdf) 
  * [Statistical Analysis Roadmap for SPSS](assets/files/Statistical%20analysis%20roadmap%20for%20SPSS.pdf)

* **Experimental Design**: Focuses on Step 2 of the 8-step generic research workflow and covers the key aspects of experimental design that you may need to apply in your research. Topics include sampling, validity, randomisation, bias, blocking, and replication. The workshop provides the opportunity to discuss your own research questions and associated experimental design.
  * [Experimental Design v1.23](assets/files/Experimental%20Design%20v%201.23.pdf)

* **Power and Sample Size**: These calculations will help you to determine the number of necessary subjects to include in your study, for completion of ethics and grant requirements, ensuring that you have thoroughly thought about your study design.
  * [Power and Sample Size v22.12](assets/files/Power%20and%20sample%20size%20v22.12%20handout.pdf) 
  * [Power Simulation RMarkdown](assets/files/Example1-simulation.Rmd)

  * [Power and Sample Size - SPSS Workflow v1](assets/files/Power%and%sample%size%-%SPSS%v1.pdf)



#### Statistical Modelling 

* **Linear Models 1**: Explains how the common analyses of regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA and repeated measures can all be doneÂ using the same workflow, since they are all based on the Linear Models workflow.
  * [Linear Models 1 v1.22](assets/files/Linear%20Models%20I%20-%20regression%2C%20ANOVA%2C%20ANCOVA%2C%20repeated%20measures%20HANDOUTS%20v1.22%2029-8-2022.pdf)
 
* **Linear Models 2**: Extends the Linear Model workflow to the Generalised Linear Model (GLM) framework for non-normal distributions such as Logistic and Count/Poisson regression. Aligning all these different methods into the same box with the same generic workflow makes it much easier for you to understand and remember how to apply them, while the practical examples provided give clear instructions for later use. 
  * [Linear Models 2 v2.8](assets/files/Linear%20Models%20II%20Logistic%20and%20Poisson%20regression-an%20intro%20to%20GLMs%20HANDOUTS%20v2.8%202-9-2022.pdf)
  
* **Linear Models 3**: Explores the issues around more complex statistical model building and provides suitable workflows e.g. reporting and interpretation using Estimated Marginal Means (EMMs), confidence vs prediction intervals, applying and correcting for multiple comparisons, reporting variable *importance*, etc. As well as model parameterisation using the design matrix (interpreting categorical predictor parameters, dummy coding, effects coding) and more on mixed models (introducing the random slope).
  * [Linear Models 3 v1.42](assets/files/Linear%20Models%20III%20Advanced%20Topics%20Tricks%20and%20Tips%20HANDOUTS%20v1.42%206-10-2022.pdf)

* **Statistical Model Building**: Introduces and discusses the different methods and issues around building complex statistical models.
  * [Statistical Model Building v1.5](assets/files/SIH%20SC%20Statistical%20Model%20Building%20v1.5%20presented%2022-05-25.pdf)


#### Specialist Statistics 

* **Design and Analysis of Surveys 1**: This workshop is full of practical tips and guidelines on how to design, field, and analyse the more commonly used survey types. The initial focus is on how to set up and field a study. A variety of different questions and scales, including some unorthodox and novel ones, will be presented to give an appreciation of what is possible. Some of the topics covered will be line versus discrete scales, the effect of colour, optimal discrete/likert scales etc.
  * [Surveys 1 v2.7](assets/files/Surveys%201%20-%20An%20Introduction%20HANDOUTS%20v2.7%204-10-2022.pdf)

* **Design and Analysis of Surveys 2**: This workshop builds on the information from Surveys 1. It explores topics including questionnaire validation and index creation using methods such as Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and conjoint models such as Choice Modelling.
  * [Surveys 2 v1.3](assets/files/Surveys%202%20-%20Advanced%20Topics%20HANDOUTS%20v1.3%204-10-2022.pdf)

* **Multivariate Statistical Analysis 1 - Dimension Reduction**: In multivariate statistics we simultaneously model and estimate variability in more than one variable often in order to examine the relationship between variables. This workshop examines the key aspects of moving from univariate to multivariate analysis, and the situations where multivariate analysis is typically applied. 
  * [Multivariate Statistical Analysis 1: Dimension Reduction v1.7](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/stats-resources/raw/28492665b71621fa91477e6553768d66c0d2b4d3/Multivariate%20Statistical%20Analysis%20v1.7%20handouts.pdf)

* **Meta-Analysis - An Introduction**: This workshop provides you with a theoretical and practical introduction to meta-analysis as part of a systematic review. In this workshop, you will be examining the process of performing a meta-analysis, in particular focusing on key statistical concepts such as heterogeneity and fixed and random effects modelling.

  * [Example R Script](assets/files/Meta-Analysis%20workshop%20example%2022-06.R)

* **Introduction to Survival Analysis**: Survival analysis is used when you want to measure the time elapsed up to when a specified event occurs. In this workshop, you will be introduced to some key concepts pertaining to survival analysis including censoring of cases, the survival function, and the hazard ratio estimator. The Kaplan Meier survival curve will be explained through a worked example and the technique of Cox Proportional Hazards Regression will be introduced using the same example dataset.

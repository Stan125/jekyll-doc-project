**Collett, D. "Modelling survival data in medical research‚Äù** [@Sydney Uni library](https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/1367smt/scopus2-s2.0-85053657101)

*Jim says: This is a good all-round reference for survival analysis. It is written at an intermediate level (of statistical knowledge) but in an easy to read style. A highly recommended starting point.*
